# Aerotools
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/aerotools/badge/?version=latest)](https://aerotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)  


### Overview  
Tools that may or may not have been useful to me as an Aerospace student.  Currently mostly just for practice building a python project.

### Installing
Aerotools is not currently available on pypi.  To install, download the repo and run the following command from the directory:  
`pip install .`  
Pip should automatically download required packages.



### Testing  
After downloading the repository, you may launch the test application:  
`pytest`  
Tests may be run without installing the package through pip or setup.py.  This allows for changes to be tested without a package reinstall.
